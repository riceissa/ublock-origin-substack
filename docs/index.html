    <h1>uBlock Origin filter rules generator for Substack</h1>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/riceissa/ublock-origin-substack">GitHub repo</a></p>

    <label for="domainInput">Enter your domains here (i.e., domains of websites
        which use Substack as their platform but which have a custom domain),
        comma-separated:</label>
    <textarea id="domainInput" rows="15" placeholder="example.com"></textarea>

    <button id="generateBtn">Generate output and copy to clipboard</button>

    <p><strong>You can copy-paste the output into the "My filters" tab in
    uBlock Origin.</strong>
    To find the "My filters" tab, click on the uBlock Origin icon in your
    browser toolbar, then click on the icon which looks like three gears and
    which says "Open the dashboard" when you hover over it (if you cannot find
    the three gears icon, you may need to click the button that says
    "More&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v" a few times.), then in the new screen there
    should be some tabs at the top, one of which is "My filters". You can now paste
    the output into the text box there, then click "Apply
    changes". When you reload any of the Substack websites, you should see that the
    cosmetic annoyances have disappeared.</p>

    <p>Clicking the button above will also store the list of domains in your
    browser so that when you return to this page, it will be your personal list
    of domains instead of the original list (try refreshing this page right now).
    The list above is comma-separated, which is the same format uBlock Origin uses for
    its domain list, so that you can also later copy-paste the list of domains
    from your uBlock Origin filter rules, if for some reason your browser
    has forgotten the list of domains above.</p>

    <div id="outputWrapper" class="output-container hidden">
        <label>Generated output (you don't need to copy what is shown below;
            clicking the button should have already copied what is shown below
            into your clipboard):</label>
        <pre id="outputBlock"></pre>
    </div>

    <div id="toast">Copied to clipboard!</div>
